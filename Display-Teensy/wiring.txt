3-5V Vin connects to the Arduino 5V pin
GND connects to Arduino ground
CLK connects to SPI clock. On Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/328-based, thats Digital 13. On Mega's, its Digital 52 and on Leonardo/Due its ICSP-3 (See SPI Connections for more details)
MISO connects to SPI MISO. On Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/328-based, thats Digital 12. On Mega's, its Digital 50 and on Leonardo/Due its ICSP-1 (See SPI Connections for more details)
MOSI connects to SPI MOSI. On Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/328-based, thats Digital 11. On Mega's, its Digital 51 and on Leonardo/Due its ICSP-4 (See SPI Connections for more details)
CS connects to our SPI Chip Select pin. We'll be using Digital 10 but you can later change this to any pin
D/C connects to our SPI data/command select pin. We'll be using Digital 9 but you can later change this pin too.
